“Figure4_metadata_and_organized_alpha_diversity.txt” was generated by "alpha_and_beta_diversity_calculation.R" (using "simulated_abundance_for_five_habitats" as input) and was slightly modifed to fit the R script.
The paired Wilcoxon test was performed separately and used to modify the figure (e.g. the stars showing significance).
