Simulated sequencing data can be found in https://figshare.com/projects/Challenges_in_Benchmarking_Metagenomic_Profilers/79916

Profiling results by different classifiers are stored in "Fig3/Profiling results". organized_distance_matrix.txt is generated by "alpha_and_beta_diversity_calculation.R" and the format was slightly modified to fit the R script (modification was performed for "Figure3_metadata_and_organized_metrics.txt" and "FigureS1_metadata_and_organized_metrics.txt" as well).
