Profiling results by different classifiers are stored in "Profiling results". organized_distance_matrix.txt is generated by "alpha_and_beta_diversity_calculation.R" and the format was slightly modified to fit the R script (modification was performed for "Figure3_metadata_and_organized_metrics.txt" and "FigureS1_metadata_and_organized_metrics.txt" as well).

“Precision_Recall_F1.txt” is organized according to the ouput of "AUPRC calculation/PR_analysis-12-24-2020.ipynb" which use "AUPRC calculation/D_M_K_m_Raw_AbdTable_1225.txt" as input file.
