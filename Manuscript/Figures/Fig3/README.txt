Profiling results by different classifiers are stored in "Profiling results". organized_distance_matrix.txt is generated by "alpha_and_beta_diversity_calculation.R" and the format was slightly modified to fit the R script (modification was performed for "Figure3_metadata_and_organized_metrics.txt" and "FigureS1_metadata_and_organized_metrics.txt" as well).
