"alpha_and_beta_diversity_calculation.R" is used to calculate alpha diversity (Shannon and Simpson index) and beta diversity (L1, L2, BC, and rJSD) based on an abundance table, input examples (i.e. the data used in the manuscript) can be found in "profiling_results_by_different_profilers" and "simulated_abundance_for_five_habitats".

"profiling_results_by_different_profilers" stored the profiling results generated by different profilers (e.g. Bracken, Kraken2, mOTUs2, and MetaPhlAn2).

"simulated_abundance_for_five_habitats" stored the simulated abundance tables (for both sequence abundance and taxonomic abundance as ground truth) by "simulation_abd_v1.2.R".

"rAD_RPCA.ipynb" shows how we calculated the robust Aitchison distance.
